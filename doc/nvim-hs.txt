Functions to help start nvim-hs plugins                               *nvim-hs*

This plugin provides functions to start and compile nvim-hs plugins. The main
intent for this plugin is to allow users of nvim-hs plugins to install them as
they do normal nvim plugins. If you want to control the default behavior of
how to build nvim-hs plugins, set the variable g:nvimhsPluginStarter
appropriately, just pick one of the following lines: >

  let g:nvimhsPluginStarter=nvimhs#stack#pluginstarter()
<
If the compilation of a plugin failed, the build output and commands to
reproduce the build are openend in a new tabpage.

The remaining documentation is only useful for nvim-hs plugin authors and to
debug errors of this plugin.

USAGE                                                             *nvimhsUsage*

As a plugin author, you have to add a little boilerplate to your repository.

The steps in this section only make sense if you have a haskell library that
exposes a neovim plugin. A tutorial on how to write that can be found here:

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvim-hs/docs/Neovim-Plugin.html

First, you have to add an executable section to the .cabal file of your
plugin. >
  executable nvim-hs-my-plugin
    main-is:              Main.hs
    hs-source-dirs:       executable
    default-language:     Haskell2010
    ghc-options:          -threaded -rtsopts -with-rtsopts=-N
    build-depends:        base >=4.9 && <5
                        , nvim-hs
                        , nvim-hs-my-plugin
<
You only have to adjust the name of the executable (here: nvim-hs-my-plugin)
and the dependency to nvim-hs-my-plugin to how you named you plugin. You
probably wnat to name the executable and library the same way.

Then you create the file Main.hs in the directory executable with the following
content: >
  module Main where

  import Neovim

  import qualified Module.With.MyPlugin as MyPlugin

  main :: IO ()
  main = neovim defaultConfig { plugins = [ MyPlugin.plugin ] }
<
Create a file that is loaded by neovim on startup or when the apropriate
filetype is opened and add the following line (e.g. to plugin/start.vim): >

  call nvimhs#start(expand('<sfile>:p:h:h'), 'name-of-executable', [])
<
The first argument must be the directory of the plugin. It will usually look
the same as in the example and only the number of ':h' suffixes may change
according to the depth of the vim file.

The second argument is the name of the executable which must match the
executable entry in the '.cabal' file of the plugin.

The third argument is the command line arguments to pass to the executable,
usually an empty list. For debugging purposes, adding a log file and the log
level can be helpful. E.g.: >
  ['-v', 'DEBUG', '-l', '/tmp/myplugin.log']
<

EXTENDING                                                     *nvimhsExtending*

This plugin provides basically three things.

1. Plugin starters

  These are basically instructions on how to build and run a plugin. If you
  favorite build tool isn't in there, feel free to create the appropriate
  plugin starter and open a pull request.

  An implementation provides an object with the following elments:

  - buildCommand

    This function is passed the name of the plugin executable and must return
    a command line that can be passed to |jobstart|. It is executed with the
    plugin's directory as the working directory. Example: >

        function! nvimhs#stack#buildCommand(name)
                return [ 'stack', 'build', a:name ]
        endfunction
<
  - exePath

    This function is passed the directory of the plugin and the name of the
    plugin executable and should return the full path to the executable.
    Example: >

        function! nvimhs#stack#exePath(workingDirectory, name)
                let l:stackPath = nvimhs#execute(a:workingDirectory,
                        \ ['stack', 'path', '--local-install-root'])

                return join(l:stackPath, '') . '/bin/' . a:name
        endfunction
<

2. Test code if an executable has to be rebuild

  This can be as simple as testing whether the git commit hash of the last
  build is different to the current commit hash of the plugin directory.

3. Functions to start an nvim-hs based plugin.

  General code improvement are always welcome.
